# C3 Model Lifecycle Management & Change Control

## Control Objective

AI systems must implement change control processes that prevent unauthorized or unsafe model modifications from reaching production. This control ensures model integrity through the entire lifecycle--from development through deployment to decommissioning--which enables rapid incident response and maintains accountability for all changes.

**Core Security Goal:** Only authorized, validated models reach production by employing controlled processes that maintain integrity, traceability, and recoverability.

## C3.1 Model Authorization & Integrity

Only authorized models with verified integrity reach production environments.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.1.1** | **Verify that** all model artifacts (weights, configurations, tokenizers) are cryptographically signed by authorized entities before deployment. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.1.2** | **Verify that** dependency tracking maintains a real-time inventory that enables identification of all consuming systems. | 2 | V |
| **3.1.3**  | **Verify that** model provenance records include an authorizing entity's identity, training data checksums, validation test results with pass/fail status, and a creation timestamp. | 3 | D/V |

---

## C3.2 Model Validation & Testing

Models must pass defined security and safety validations before deployment.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.2.1** | **Verify that** models undergo automated security testing that includes input validation, output sanitization, and safety evaluations with pre-agreed organizational pass/fail thresholds before deployment. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.2.2** | **Verify that** all model changes (deployment, configuration, retirement) generate immutable audit records including a timestamp, an authenticated actor identity, a change type, and before/after states. | 1 | V |
| **3.2.3** | **Verify that** validation failures automatically block model deployment after explicit override approval from pre-designated authorized personnel with documented business justifications. | 2 | D/V |

---

## C3.3 Controlled Deployment & Rollback

Model deployments must be controlled, monitored, and reversible.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.3.1** | **Verify that** deployment processes validate cryptographic signatures and compute integrity checksums before model activation, failing deployment on any mismatch. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.3.2** | **Verify that** production deployments implement gradual rollout mechanisms (canary deployments, blue-green deployments) with automated rollback triggers based on pre-agreed error rates, latency thresholds, or security alert criteria. | 1 | D |
| **3.3.3** | **Verify that** rollback capabilities restore the complete model state (weights, configurations, dependencies) atomically. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.3.4** | **Verify that** emergency model shutdown capabilities can disable model endpoints within pre-defined response. | 3 | D/V |

---

## C3.4 Secure Development Practices

Model development and training processes must follow secure practices to prevent compromise.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.4.1** | **Verify that** model development, testing, and production environments are physically or logically separated. They have no shared infrastructure, distinct access controls, and isolated data stores. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.4.2**  | **Verify that** model development artifacts (hyperparameters, training scripts, configuration files, prompt templates etc) are stored in version control and require peer review approval before use in training. | 1 | D |
| **3.4.3** | **Verify that** model training and fine-tuning occur in isolated environments with controlled network access. | 2 | D/V |
| **3.4.4** | **Verify that** training data sources are validated through integrity checks and authenticated via trusted sources with documented chain of custody before use in model development. | 2 | D |

---

## C3.5 Model Retirement & Decommissioning

Models must be securely retired when they are no longer needed or when security issues are identified.

| # | Description | Level | Role |
|:--------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| **3.5.1** | **Verify that** retired model artifacts are securely wiped using secure cryptographic erasure. | 1 | D/V |
| **3.5.2** | **Verify that** model retirement events are logged with timestamp and actor identity, and model signatures are revoked to prevent reuse. | 2 | V |
